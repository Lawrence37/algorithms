# Parsing
Many people find string parsing to be difficult, but it’s fairly easy once you’ve learned a good approach. One such approach is treating the string as an expression of a language. The language consists of a set of rules, called the grammar. Backus-Naur Form is one way to express the grammar. Each rule can be translated into a procedure which parses a particular structure. When each rule has a procedure, the parser is complete. The specifics of how to deduce the grammar and translate the rules into procedures requires a longer explanation and is not included here. There are, however, implementations following this technique.
