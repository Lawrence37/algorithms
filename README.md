# Algorithms
This repository is intended to be a small collection of common algorithms for educational and demonstration purposes. Implementations exist in several programing languages. Some implementations are meant to be simple and easy to read while others are optimized for performance.

## Purpose
This repository should be useful. It is NOT supposed to be a comprehensive collection of algorithms. Many such repositories exist. The purpose is to provide a concise set of interesting, useful, and/or noteworthy algorithms, preferably ones which have not been discussed ad nauseam. This repository is also the place for special implementations of common algorithms.

## Tests
There are tests for algorithm correctness and performance.

### C++
Tests for C++ algorithms can be run by compiling the test source code and running the resulting executable. Optimization flags are recommended for performance tests to best represent production software. Debug flags may be used to inspect how implementations work.
```shell
cd sorting/merge_sort
g++ test.cpp -o test.out -O2
./test.out
```

### Python 3
Python tests can be run from the repositoryâ€™s root directory. Run the tests as modules with the `-m` flag.
```shell
python -m sorting.merge_sort.test
```
