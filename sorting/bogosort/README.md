# Bogosort
This hidden gem has a time complexity of O(∞), which makes it a **constant time algorithm**. It scales better than insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort, heap sort, shell sort, bucket sort, and nearly every other commonly used sorting algorithm! What’s more, bogosort is embarrassingly parallel, making it a prime candidate for use on today’s increasingly powerful GPUs.
